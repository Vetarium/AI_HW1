Aron Karatayev HW 1
Yolo4 model

Yolo model has two main parts weights and config also it has coco names file with names of things to detect.

weight is how the model trained to detect the objects from the image or video
config is the file describing how the model works

we use openCV to make it work

then model gets the image firsty it resizes to suitable format for the model 416 x 416 but not crops
then it goes to the processing of frame and coordinates of detected object there model has confidence parameter to display how model confident about the detected item.

it builds the frame around our object and displays the name from coco  names
